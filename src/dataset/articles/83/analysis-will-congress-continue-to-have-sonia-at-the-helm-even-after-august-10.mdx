As 
 on August 10, there is still no clarity on the way forward with regard to appointing a full-time president.

If the party extends

The CWC, however, is unlikely to meet any time soon as all the attention is on the

The party’s plan of a revamp, including appointment of a fulltime president is now caught between the Sachin Pilot-led rebellion in Rajasthan and the ongoing pandemic.
