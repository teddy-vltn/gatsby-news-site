The country’s total number of recoveries from 
 has surged close to 11 lakh, while the case fatality rate has declined from 3.33 % in mid-June to 2.15 %, the lowest since lockdown was clamped in March, the Union Health Ministry said on Saturday.
In the global platform, India continues to register and maintain the lowest COVID-19 mortality rate, it said and asserted that this is a testimony to the focused, coordinated, pre-emptive, graded and evolving “test, track, treat” strategy and efforts of the Centre, states and Union Territories.

With 36,569 patients discharged in 24 hours, the total number of recoveries has jumped to 10,94,374 on Saturday and exceed active COVID-19 cases by 5,29,271. There are 5,65,103 active cases in the country at present, according to Health Ministry data updated at 8 a.m. on Saturday.
 “The recovery rate stands at 64.53 %,” the Ministry said.
 “Emphasis on early detection through aggressive testing and effective clinical management of the hospitalised cases have resulted in the continuously falling case fatality rate (CFR), indicating that India has been able to successfully contain the fatality rate of COVID-19,” it said.
 While the CFR has been kept low, successful implementation of effective containment strategy, aggressive testing and standardised clinical management protocols based on a comprehensive standard of care approach have resulted in a consistent addition of more than 30,000 recoveries daily, the Health Ministry said.
 It also said that three-tier hospital infrastructure with seamless patient management has ensured prompt triaging and treatment.
